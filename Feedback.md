## Feedback 

Nice work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 

### Task 1

* The best practice is to create a requirements.txt file for a project, rather than having your pip install calls in your cells. ChatGPT is pretty good about explaining the concept.
* Smart to use the load-table-from-file. Most people did pandas, but your approach is more efficient in terms of both memory and code. 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. I appreciate that you took the time to do this with the reproducible approach. 

### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient. ChatGPT slipped in a print error on you when it called the DB Postgres instead of SQLite. Other than that it all looks good.
